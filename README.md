# SaaS Technology Performance Analysis — 2024 MRR Growth

Contact (verification): 22f3000826@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

## Overview
This repository analyzes 2024 quarterly Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) growth versus the industry benchmark target of 15%. It diagnoses the slowdown and outlines an action plan centered on expanding into new market segments. The repo includes reproducible code, visuals, and an executive-ready data story.

- Quarterly MRR Growth: Q1=7.37, Q2=4.17, Q3=10.77, Q4=12.34
- Average (2024): 8.66
- Industry Target: 15

## Key Findings
- Growth under target: Average MRR growth is 8.66, which is 6.34 points below the 15 target (≈42% below goal).
- Mid-year trough, late-year recovery: Q2 dips to 4.17, followed by improvement in Q3 (10.77) and Q4 (12.34), signaling momentum yet still short of target.
- Insufficient trajectory: Even with Q4 at 12.34, current run-rate is unlikely to organically reach 15 without new growth vectors.

## Business Implications
- Planning risk: Underperformance compounds into ARR shortfalls, impacting hiring, product roadmap velocity, and GTM investment capacity.
- CAC payback pressure: Slower growth and limited upsell within current segments tend to lengthen payback periods and constrain marketing efficiency.
- Segment saturation: Concentration within current ICPs suggests diminishing returns; expanding TAM exposure is essential to unlock step-change growth.

## Recommendations to Reach the Target of 15
1) Expand into new market segments (primary solution)
- Identify 2–3 adjacent ICPs with ≥70% product fit and low switching friction.
- Prioritize segments with clear compliance/operational needs to improve retention and willingness-to-pay.
- Execute via dedicated segment pods (PMM, Sales, CS, SE) with tailored messaging, references, and playbooks.

2) Pricing and packaging acceleration
- Launch segment-specific bundles and pilots for value-based pricing; monetize add-ons tied to measurable outcomes to lift ARPU.

3) Product-led growth (PLG) boosters
- Improve activation (AHA ≤15 minutes), segment-tuned onboarding, and in-app expansion nudges; establish PQL scoring and cohort reviews.

4) Channels and partnerships
- Form 2–3 segment-relevant partnerships (MSPs/SIs/marketplaces) to compress CAC and build trust faster in new ICPs.

5) Measurement and pacing
- Set a QoQ lift target of +2–3 points in MRR growth driven by new-segment pipeline mix.
- Track segment-level MRR growth, CAC payback, NRR, and win rates; scale segments that meet thresholds, pivot quickly where they do not.

## Data and Method
- Data (2024 MRR growth)
  - Q1: 7.37
  - Q2: 4.17
  - Q3: 10.77
  - Q4: 12.34
  - Average: 8.66
  - Industry Target: 15

- Method
  - Compute and validate the average equals 8.66.
  - Compare against industry target (15) and calculate the gap (6.34).
  - Visualize the quarterly trend vs. target and average vs. target.
